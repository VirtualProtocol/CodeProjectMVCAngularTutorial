----------
 Purpose
----------

This code represents my attempt to better understand how Angular interacts with C# and ASP.Net in an MVC application 
using web services. I am using the tutorial on Code Project here:
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/806029/Getting-started-with-AngularJS-and-ASP-NET-MVC-Par. If it isn't clear by
now, this is also my first attempt at writing a README file. 

--------------
 Technologies
--------------
This tutorial uses the .Net Framework, ngRoute, and AngularUI to build an MVC application using ASP.Net and Angular.js
